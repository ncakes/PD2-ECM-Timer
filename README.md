# ECM Timer

## Overview

Key features and options:

- **ECM Timer:** Adds a timer to the HUD when an ECM is active. If multiple ECMs are active, the longest duration is used. No distinction is made between basic and pager-blocking ECMs. Pocket ECMs are not displayed.

## Acknowledgments

The code was written by LazyOzzy originally and can be found [here](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/payday-2-a/122868-ecm-duration-timer.html). I have ported it to BLT and made a few adjustments to the icon and counter.
